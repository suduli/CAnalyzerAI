# Bug Fixes Applied Based on Console Logs

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ CFGCalculator Redeclaration Error
**Problem:** `cfg-calculator.js` was included twice in index.html
**Fix:** Removed duplicate script inclusion
**File:** `index.html`

### 2. ✅ sys is not defined Error  
**Problem:** `sys` object was scoped locally but accessed globally
**Fix:** Added `window.sys = sys;` to expose sys globally

### 4. ✅ Particle System Container Conflicts
**Problem:** Both light and matrix particles were using the same container `particles-js`
**Fix:** 
- Created separate container `light-particles-js` for light theme particles

- Modified light-theme-particles.js to use the new container
**Files:** `index.html`, `style.css`, `light-theme-particles.js`

**Fix:**
